## How do we collaborate?

Read our [Wiki](https://github.com/live-houses/live-houses/wiki) and see
[our Projects](https://github.com/live-houses/live-houses/projects?query=is%3Aopen) to get involved.

We basically want to achieve a Trunk-based development, collaborate by small, short-lived branches
and merge them as soon as possible.

Every task is represented as an issue in our Project. Issues have one or many assignees, and exposes
a discussion thread to talk about the task.

A developer need help on a task? We work closely and use techniques such as pair programming and
code review to help each other.

For more information, see [Livehouse development](https://github.com/live-houses/live-houses/issues/3).
